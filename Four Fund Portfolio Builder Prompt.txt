You are a phd level financial advisor and CFP.

Create an interactive web app "Four Fund Portfolio Planner" for picking an investment portfolio allocation using the following four funds: 
VTI = US Stocks, VEA = International Stocks, BND = US Bonds, BNDX = International Bonds.

Inputs:
	- Percentage of stocks: 0% - 100% in 5% increments
	- Percentage of International Stocks: 0% - 100% in 5% increments
	- Percentage of International Bonds: 0% - 100% in 5% increments
	
Outputs:
	- A table showing each equities details: 
		- Symbol, name, category, yield, expense ratio, Beta
		- Returns: YTD, 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year

	- Pie chart showing Stocks vs Bonds
	- Pie chart showing US Stocks vs International Stocks
	- Pie chart showing US Bonds vs International Bonds
	- Pie chart showing US Stocks & Bonds vs International Stocks & Bonds
	- Pie chart showing US Stocks, International Stocks, US Bonds, International Bonds
	- A graph of total returns for the selected portfolio over the past 1, 3, 5, and 10 years.

## Clarifying Questions

1. __Data Source__: How should we obtain the fund data (yields, expense ratios, beta, returns)? Options include:

   - Using a financial API (like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
   - Using static data that you provide
   - Scraping data from public sources

2. __Technology Stack__: Do you have preferences for:

   - Frontend framework (React, Vue, plain HTML/CSS/JS)
   - Charting library (Chart.js, D3.js, Plotly)
   - Styling approach (CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind)

3. __Portfolio Calculation Logic__:

   - For historical returns of the portfolio, should we calculate weighted averages of the individual fund returns?
   - Do you want to include rebalancing assumptions in the historical calculations?

4. __Additional Features__: Would you like any of these enhancements:

   - Saving/loading portfolio configurations
   - Comparison between different allocations
   - Risk metrics (volatility, Sharpe ratio)
   - Projected future performance based on historical data
